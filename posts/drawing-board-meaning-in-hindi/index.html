Just drag and drop a file onto your desktop, and you&rsquo;re ready to go! Second, they are beautiful. Most wallpaper files come in high-quality JPEGs or PNGs, which makes them perfect for displaying on your computer or phone. And finally, they&rsquo;re versatile. You can use them as a background for photos or videos, or as the main screen saver on your device.
